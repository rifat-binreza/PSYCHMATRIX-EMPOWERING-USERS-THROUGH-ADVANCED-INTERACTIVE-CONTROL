# PsychMatrix - Mobile App & Thesis Code

This repository contains the PsychMatrix project: an assistive hand-gesture based home automation system. I added the mobile app screens, helper components, hooks, README, placeholders and the Arduino/ESP sketches you provided earlier.

## How to run (quick)
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
2. Start Expo: `expo start`
3. Make sure `google-services.json` is present for Android if you use @react-native-firebase
4. The app reads Firebase RTDB path `controller/` — make sure your Firebase project is configured and database rules allow reads.
